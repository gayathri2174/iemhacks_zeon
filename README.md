Problem Statement - Real-Time Insights for Precision Care and Electronic Health Records (EHR)

Rural healthcare faces challenges due to inadequate patient data capture in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This lack of data, particularly for rare medical cases, hinders the transition to value-based care models. To improve decision-making, healthcare providers must align EHRs, manage unstructured data, and use Interactive Machine Learning (iML) techniques. This integration aims to bridge the gap between structured and unstructured data, enriching patient health profiles and enabling more informed care.
